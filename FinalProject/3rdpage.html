            <h3>Real-Life Applications</h3>

            <p>In real life, obsidian has been used historically for making sharp tools, such as arrowheads and knives. Due to its ability to break into extremely sharp edges, it has even been used in modern surgical scalpel blades. Additionally, obsidian is a popular material for decorative objects and jewelry. Volcanic glass, as it is sometimes called, has been highly valued by ancient civilizations for its durability and aesthetic appeal.</p>
